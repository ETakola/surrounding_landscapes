# surrounding_landscapes

* **"gee_"** files contain the Google Earth Engine code, that you can directly copy into the GEE console and run it. You might need to download the data and upload it in your assets, and use your asset instead of mine for the feature collection.
the data prcoessing can be found in the **surrounding_landscapes_report** Rmd and html.
No pdf is available since some characters from csv files could not be converted to UTF-8. 
Still, you can open the html and download it as pdf. 

The Google Earth Engine code to import the landcover datasets and buffer the points can be found in **gee_landcover_with_buffer**
